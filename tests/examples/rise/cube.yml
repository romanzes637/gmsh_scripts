# To add new cylinders:
# 1. Add /cylinder.yml to children
# 2. Add transformations for new child at children_transforms, e.g.
# [ [ 1, 2, 3 ], [0, 0, 1, 42] ], where
# [ 1, 2, 3 ] - translate child on 1 by X, 2 by Y and 3 by Z axis,
# NOTE! Origin of cylinder - it's bottom surface
# [0, 0, 1, 42] - rotate child around Z axis (0, 0, 1) by 42 degrees counterclockwise
# To increase mesh quality decrease Mesh.MeshSizeFactor first!
